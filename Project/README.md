Comparing the performance of Tarjan-Vishkin algorithm with and without DSUs

## Execution

- for each code, run the command `g++ -std=c++17 -Ofast filename.cpp -o filename`
- and then run `./filename < input_file > output_file`
- to generate random graphs use `randomgraph.cpp` and run `./randomgraph > input_file`
- number of vertices and edges can be changed in the code

## Assumptions

- The graph need not be connected
- graph need not be simple
- graph doesn't have self loops
